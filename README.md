# SudokuBacktracking
A program that solves Sudoku's by backtracking. it's good-ish commented.
It may be a bit inefficent, but it was just a small few hours project.
Should in theory be able to solve any solvebable sudokus


And one that solve using Human stategies. Not that well commented, will get to it though.
Alot more effienct, but  can't solve everything

# How to use
You have to write the sudoku you want to solve as an array inside main, and call sudokuSolve(yourArray) or solveSudoku(yourArray) depending on which solver you use. (I will get to it, and make it so the functions have the same name).


# Things I might do
Input the sudoku via the CMD,
or just ask you to use some of the already created once.
